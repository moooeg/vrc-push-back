# Frij 75477M

This repository contains team 75477M's code for the [2025-2026 Push Back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocmONiVun9M) season of the VEX robotics competition.

Having the code in a git remote allows us to collaborate as a team easily as everyone has access to the codebase and any changes can immediately be reflected across all our devices.

#### Programming Info

- Frij's code uses purely Python. You can find the wiring guide at the top of [main.py](https://github.com/moooeg/vrc-push-back/blob/main/src/main.py) for the brain's port configuration.
- Our program includes a selection screen for easily selecting autonomous code suited for each starting position.

Thank you, from the Frij team,

_Eric, Thomas, Johnson, Judy, Niki, Teresa & Ethan_
